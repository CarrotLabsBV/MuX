A Java based Seafight Server, ONLY for personal usage [yet^^]!

===

It just begun as a game like Seafight, owned by Bigpoint S.a.r.l.
I wondered, how they would like it to be played as the players of Seafight are being Played :-)

===

Updates expecting:

- Main Netty connection
- Hibernate for DAO
- Server Set-up & ready to accept clients
- PacketResolver, PacketHandler, PacketSender; Netty tunnel's
- A fully (As far possible) GUI in de SWF File of Seafight (Including all gaming options like the real Seafight)
